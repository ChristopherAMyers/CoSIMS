This is an exmaple of hwo to change the force field
parameters and how to add additional atom types using
the optional atom-type file. Here, we change the parameters
of the Phosphate atom by either changing the symbol to
"PT" in the .pdb file, or by using the integer mass of
"310" in the .mfj file. Note that the integer mass does
not actually change the mass of the particle, it is simply
used as an integer to idenfity various particles with.

Just call the program using
the -a option on the atoms.dat file. Both .pdb and .mfj
can be used with alternate atom types. Please see the
manual for further details.
