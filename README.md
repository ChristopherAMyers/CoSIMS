# CoSIMS
CoSIMS is a Collision Simulator for Ion Mobility Spectrometry. This is a trajectory based method for calculating molecular colision cross-sections for use with IMS-MS experiments. We welcome the submission of bugs, improvements, and suggestions to the code.

If you find this code usefull, we ask that you please cite the following paper:
